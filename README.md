# BGKLineChartView
Simple implementation of a line chart for iOS.

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

I believe that majority of the time I am not in need of a complex custom chart, but really a simple - straight forward line chart. When boiling down my use cases I found that majority of my needs were for a chart to display it's extents, and to graphically show data inside of its extents.

## This framework aims to accomplish the following:
* Simple UI by limiting complex UI elements and styles, yet provide a thoughtful approach to styling
* Lightweight API with a focus on reducing complex object maps
* API pattern familiar to and common to iOS developers

### It does not have the goal of:
* Replacing current well documented and supported charting frameworks that provide robust customization

## Installation
This project supports Carthage. 

Simply add `brendenk1/BGKLineChartView` to your Cartfile.
